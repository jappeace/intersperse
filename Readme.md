> There are too many monads.


This is a small experiment in figuring out if I could ~~abuse~~ 
monads to measure progress in the most generic way thinkable.
The anwser looks like no.

~~Intersperse library allows some sideffect to be called for every bind
call.~~

~~This allows you to measure progress in some background job for example.~~
